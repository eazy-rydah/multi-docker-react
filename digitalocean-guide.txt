Hi Tauren-

I haven't gone through this process myself, but I did put a lot of thought into it - I was originally going to show DO deployment in this course instead of AWS.

Steps:
1) Create a DO droplet: https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/docker/

2) Configure travis to be able to SSH into the droplet.  Steps #1,2 here: https://medium.com/@tibotiber/deployment-of-static-websites-to-digital-ocean-using-travisci-957e6e0f1f9d

3) Wire up a custom deployment script in the travis.yml file instead of the AWS EB stuff I show.  Directions on how to do that: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/script

4) In the deployment script, ssh into the droplet, pull the latest docker images, stop the existing containers, and start up a new one using the latest image


Note that with #4 there will a service interruption - there will be a period of time where no server is running, so any user trying to access your page will see an error message.  That was a part that I never looked into.
